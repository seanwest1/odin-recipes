    <h2>Description</h2>
    A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy; this lasagna made with spinach pasta cannot be beat. It's excellent if you want to impress some guests, or even yourself. It may be a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    Pasta
    <li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>⅝ cup semolina flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3>Directions</h3>        
    <ol>
    <li>For the pasta dough: Steam the spinach in a steamer or over boiling water until bright green for 2 minutes.</li> 
    <li>Squeeze to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Combine spinach with eggs, semolina, and salt and process until smooth.</li>
    <li>Stir in enough of the flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, cover and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
